Read Preference (How MongoDB reads data):
- Primary: Data is read from the primary replica set only.
- PrimaryPreferred: Data is read from the primary replica set, but if the primary is unavailable, it will be read from a secondary replica set.
- Secondary: Data is read only from a secondary replica set.
- SecondaryPreferred: Data is read from a secondary replica set, but if no secondaries are available, it will fall back to the primary.
- Nearest: Data is read from the replica set member with the lowest network latency, whether itâ€™s primary or secondary.
