Read Concern in MongoDB:
Read concern defines the consistency and isolation properties of the data that you read from a MongoDB replica set.
It determines how up-to-date and consistent the data will be when queried.


Read Concern Levels:
- Local
Reads data from the local node, without any guarantees about the data's freshness or consistency with
the majority of the replica set.
- Available
Returns data from nodes that are available, even if not fully synchronized or consistent. This may
return outdated data.
- Majority
Ensures the read reflects the most recent majority-committed version of the data. It guarantees that the data
has been acknowledged by a majority of replica set members.
- Linearizable
Queries all nodes and returns the most recent data, ensuring the query is consistent with the latest write that
has been acknowledged by the majority. Provides the strongest consistency but may be slower.
- Snapshot
Reads data from a majority (quorum) of the replica set members but allows reading uncommitted data from ongoing
transactions. This provides a consistent snapshot, but without enforcing the strictest isolation.


Configuration:
    db.${collectionName}.find(
        {},
        {
            readConcern: {
                level: ${readConcernLevel}
            }
        }
    );

    Example:
    db.flightData.find(
        {},
        {
            readConcern: {
                level: "local"
            }
        }
    );
